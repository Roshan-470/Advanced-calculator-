## 📌 What the Project Does

This project offers a simple **menu-driven calculator** using Python's `math` module. It takes user input to perform various operations and is ideal for learning how to build interactive terminal-based tools.

---

## 💻 Language Used

- **Python 3.x**

No external libraries required — only built-in `math` module is used.
