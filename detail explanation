📖 Detailed Explanation
This section explains how the calculator code works step-by-step in simple language:

🧮 1. Math Module Import
• 📥 The program begins by importing the math module.
• 🧠 This allows the use of advanced mathematical operations like square root, trigonometric functions, and logarithms.

📋 2. Menu Display Function
• 🛠️ A function named show_menu() is defined to display the list of available calculator operations.
• 🔁 This function is called every time before asking the user to select an option.

🔁 3. Main Loop Execution
• 🔄 A while True loop keeps the calculator running continuously until the user decides to exit.
• 📥 Inside the loop, the menu is shown and the user's choice is taken as input.

➕ 4. Addition Operation
• ➗ Takes two numbers as input.
• ➕ Adds them and prints the result.

➖ 5. Subtraction Operation
• ➖ Subtracts the second number from the first one.
• 📤 Outputs the result.

✖️ 6. Multiplication Operation
• 🔢 Multiplies the two input numbers.
• 📤 Displays the product.

➗ 7. Division Operation
• ⚠️ Asks for numerator and denominator.
• 🚫 Checks if the denominator is zero to avoid crash.
• ✔️ If valid, performs division and shows the result.
  
🔋 8. Power Operation
• 🧮 Takes base and exponent as input.
• 🧱 Raises the base to the power of exponent using mathematical function.
• 📤 Prints the final result.

📏 9. Square Root Operation
• ✅ Takes one number as input.
• 🚫 If the number is negative, shows an error.
• ✔️ Otherwise, calculates and prints the square root.

📐 10. Trigonometric Functions
• 📥 Takes an angle in degrees.
• 🔁 Converts degrees to radians.

🎯 Calculates:

• ✅ Sine of the angle
• ✅ Cosine of the angle
• ✅ Tangent of the angle
• 📤 Displays the result of each function.

🔢 11. Logarithm (Base 10)
• 📥 Takes a positive number as input.
• 🚫 If the number is zero or negative, shows an error.
• ✔️ If valid, calculates and displays the base-10 logarithm.

🚪 12. Exit Option
• ❌ If the user selects 11 or types "exit", the loop breaks.
• 🙋‍♂️ A message is shown thanking the user and the program ends.

🚫 13. Invalid Input Handling
• ❗ If the user enters a value other than 1 to 11, it shows an error message.
• 🔁 Prompts the user to try again with a valid input.
